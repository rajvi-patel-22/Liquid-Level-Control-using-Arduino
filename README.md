# Liquid-Level-Control-using-Arduino
The system in the project works by taking input values from capacitor as a sensor. The capacitor is placed inside the tank and as the liquid level rises or decreases, the input values from the capacitor change. By calibrating according to user needs, we can set a LOW level, a MID level and a HIGH level. When the level reaches LOW or empty initially, the pump in the main tank will start up and the liquid will flow into the previous tank. User can give input using a switch to decide if he/she wants the tank to be half-full (MID). By default the pump will turn off once the level is HIGH. At some point if user wishes to turn this cycle off, there is a switch which can turn the entire system off. In case of system failure because of faulty components, if the liquid level goes above HIGH, a buzzer will go off as an alarm to the user. For better visual indication, a LED will give respective colors to indicate different levels. Red for LOW, Green for MID and Blue for HIGH. This system can work with any type of liquid as it works on the concept of dielectric medium.
